</h5>
<h5>
<hr>
</h5>
<p>We now offer online training on the following courses: <strong>MATLAB , AUTOCAD , EXCEL , JAVA &amp; C++. </strong></p>
<p>How it works. </p>
<ol>
  <li>We use a software called gotomeeting. </li>
  <li>Once you register, you get your course notes, software (where applicable) and you are assigned an Instructor. </li>
  <li>You the Trainee would be online with your Instructor at the scheduled time.</li>
  <li>You'll be able to Audio &amp; Video chat with your instructor as well as see your instructor's slides , desktop (including full interface to the software your instructor is training you on). </li>
  <li>Your instructor would be able to access your Mouse and Keyboard remotely (with your permission), incase your instructor wants to demostrate something for you to see on your system</li>
  <li>The system is done realtime, and very effective but you'll need to have a good internet connectivity. </li>
</ol>
<p>The advantage is that you can attend this training from the comfort of your home and the training can be done at anytime of the day, even by 10pm (for example), as long as the time is convenient for you and your instructor. </p>
