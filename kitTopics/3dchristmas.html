<ul>
<li> The 3D christmas light is a miniature electronics christmas tree. The PCB is designed in a way thet the shape forms a 3D christmas tree. The circuit has 16 red and yellow LEDs mounted around the tree and controlled from a transistor astable to glow elegantly.
<li> Knowledge, skills and understanding can be developed in: component recognition, Purpose PCB assembly,Vero-board soldering, use of multimeter for voltage measurements, signal tracing and fault finding e.t.c.

<li> The kit is designed specifically for class teaching but can be used as part of an individual project as well.
<li> The kit contains a PCB, Vero-board and components for two circuits, but you can order components for any number of circuits you desire (in situations requiring group work).
<li> The documentation for this kit contain: Circuit diagrams, PCB component layout diagrams,
brief introduction and background theory, testing procedure and necessary readings or measurements to take.<br>
