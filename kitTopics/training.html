<p align="left"><h3> Trident Boot-Camp Training </h3><br>
	  
	   <h4><font color = "blue">MISSION</font></h4>
           <b>To impact  practical Engineering skills and Engineering commercial awareness in the areas of Electronics , Computer , Mechanical engineering and related courses. </b></p>  


	   <h4><font color = "blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h4>

<p>
<h5>Computer Engineering</h5>
If you are studying Computer Engineering , you'll almost start getting the dividends  of doing this training immediately, irrespective of your gender (even if you are in 200level).This is because, this program covers areas of object oriented programming, A+( PC/Laptop repairs & maintenence) and web design , which are of very high demand,<br>infact there are  not enough <b>"competent professionals"</b> to meet the IT demand in the city of Lagos alone, not to talk of the whole country , mind you , we mean <b>"competent professionals"</b> not just people with certificates .<br><br>Now , because of the innovative approach we are taking rather than vocational (which is what you get when you go to the computer schools), you are guaranteed of getting very high skills and professionalism immediately after finishing this course which means you'll be able to practicalise what you have learnt , solve technical problems related to your field and make some good cash!!.<br><br> 

Also, your final year project would most likely be a <b> hardware / software</b>  or <b>embedded software</b> project . Since this course also covers embedded software and microcontrollers extensively, you won't have any problems dealing with your project. Furthermore, you'll save yourself the <b>Trouble , Headache , and Heartcahe </b> of contracting your project to the road side man.<br><br>

<h5>Electronic Engineering</h5>

Practical electronics <b>is not</b> your ability to solder and assemble a circuit or troubleshoot a faulty electronics panel!!.. Although these might be  invaluable skills to you as an engineer ( and we'll be teaching you these skills anyway), there is more to practical electronics than just soldering and coupling. It would interest you to know that you can do alot of practical electronics without even getting your hands dirty! </p>


<p>Practical electronics is your ability to solve real life problems using your professional engineering skills as an engineer. You don't need to re-invent the wheel to do this, there are many problems around you that require an innovative engineering solution. Let's look at two examples:<ul><li><b>Alternative Energy:</b> Take for instance the power situation in Nigeria. Because local engineers have not been able to come up with a clear-cut alternative energy solution, a wide range of junk inverters assembled by road-side local technicians (no disrespect), and some imported  products that don't meet required engineering standards have filled the market... This is a big window of opportunity for local engineers if you know what to do..<br><br><li><b>Software:</b> You can design an object oriented program to automate operations in local hotels, hospitals, primary & secondary schools..etc. Some of these cases are <b>application specific </b> so existing software may not be able to solve these problems spot-on.</ul></p><br><br> 


These are just two very generalised examples. This course would serve as an eye opener for you to see windows of opportunity around you, <b>and of course the knowledge applies to whether you are self employed or working for an organisation.</b><br><br>

 <p> This program is not a vocational training (where you learn some technical trade skills and become a technician), neither is it another electronics school where we start teaching you things you already know, or things you don't need to know.. what a waste of time!! <br><br><font color="#0000ff">Vocational training is short sighted. Innovation allows you to learn & upgrade todays technology while you develop tomorrows technology. Vocational training on the other hand is subject to obsolence, thats why we have made this training innovative rather than vocational.</font> 


<p> This program is a <b>skills training</b> designed specifically for undergraduates studying related engineering courses.
Most of the courses start at beginers level to jump-start you practically , then you can now proceed to advanced applications.
</p>

<h5>Mechanical Engineering</h5>
This course covers aspects of <b>Mechanical Engineering Design and Modelling</b> using autocad and matlab.The problem with learning autoCAD in a computer school is that you only learn how to use the autoCAD <b>software package</b> as a drafting tool. There is far more to autoCAD that that.

AutoCAD is not just a drafting software, it is a standard engineering design, production modelling, Programming and manufacturing (Computer Aided Manufacturing) Software. <br><br>
Our AutoCAD training is aimed to develop students ability to apply autoCAD to mechanical designs and production engineering rather than just see autoCAD as a drafting tool.
We have also added aspects of <b>Mechatronics</b> which covers aspects of electronics required for mechanical applications , so that if your mechanical design for instance requires an electronic control (stepper motor , Valve , Electronic-Timing , Wind turbine) , you  are not handicaped.


<p>
</p>


<!--This training is done in two dimensions; <b> Engineering Skills & Commercial Awareness.</b><br><br><b> ENGINEERING SKILLS:</b> This area covers the basic practical skills you need which are; <ul type="disc"><li>Basic circuit design & implementation. <br><br><li>Computer Aided Engineering design & Circuit simulation. <br><br><li> Small & Medium Scale Electronics manufacturing & relevant engineerig standards to meet. <br><br><li>Object Oriented Programming and Interfacing Electronics hardware to Computer.<br><br><li> Matlab and applications of matlab to circuit analysis and design. <br><br><li> Autocad (2D & 3D)<br><br><li> Computer Engineering with A+ certification Training. </ul><br>--> 


               
<b> COMMERCIAL AWARENESS </b><br><br> Besides the engineering skills which this program would provide , we have added commercial awareness training to this course.<br>
 No matter how savvy you are technically,<b> you won't be a happy engineer if you don't have money in your pocket!!..</b> Commercial awareness teaches you how to add commercial value to your technical skills. Lack of this knowledge is the reason why most engineers are broke! They are very skillful, analytical, savvy... but one thing is missing, they have not been able to add commercial value to their technical skills.. and this leads to frustration, change of career..etc. </p></ul></ul> <font color="blue"><b> If you are student studying any of the related engineering fields , this training would be the best investment you'll ever make towards your career!!!</font></b> 






	   <h4><font color = "blue">DELIVERY</font></h4>
This is a very well organised training. 
Each training batch is handled by an expatriate (instuctor) from the UK and 5 local trident engineers ( well trained). The instructor delivers the training while the local engineers help with the practical exercises, with the instructor moderating and co-ordinating activities.<br><br> The training rooms are fully air-conditioned and equipped with
standard training audio-visual equipments (OHP's), electronic equipments, and computers for software exercises.<br><br> 

  <h4><font color = "blue">VENUE</font></h4>
The default venue is at Trident Lagos or Abuja offices, but as the number of students increases ,  a Larger hotel venue would be used.<br><br><b>Port-harcourt Venue</b><br>
Trident does not have an office at portharcourt yet , but we hope to have an office there before January 2010, or at least a franchised dealership office that can render our services , so students registering for the Port-harcourt training are not required to pay anything for now (even the registration fee), but you can register to book your place. Any payments would be done once our office is operational in port-harcourt (before Jan 2010) to enable easy customer service and support. 

	   <h4><font color = "blue">TRAINING KIT/MATERIALS</font></h4>

You'll get materials and training kit at the begining of the trianing , You'll also get tutor supplort online after the training, so that you could get answers to questions on the course materials. The training kit for electronic courses contain Breadboard, Digital multimeter, Soldering eqiuipment and components required for your experiments, and it is yours to keep. Also, course notes, workbook and CD containing all software required are included for all the training courses.

<font color="blue">Q. Why is there nothing like TV repairs & CD player repairs in the electronics module ?</font><br><br>

<b>ANS.</b> Because 21st century Electronic gadgets are designed in a way that it is cheaper to replace than repair, furthermore TV repairs is going extinct in Nigeria (it is already extinct in europe and advance countries), becuase "TV boxes" using CRT are been replacedced by LCD and plasma TVs which are much cheaper to replace than repair. So if you do a vocational training on TVs , video and CD player repairs for instance, you won't have any jobs to do in the near future when these technology move on!! This brings us back to the short- sightedness of vocational training!!<br> We have instead , added PC/Laptop repairs to the training program. Be rest assured that this technology is here to stay  and at least in the next 50yrs you'll be in business as long as you are willing to update and upgrade your knowledge base <br> Furthermore you'll know the principles of how these devices(TVs etc) work anyway , if you do  any of our electronic courses.<br><br><br>
