<font size = "3" font color="blue">TRAINING TERMS AND CONDITIONS. </font><hr><br><ol>

<li> All tuition fee must be paid in full before commencement of the training. The training is non deferrable and the tuition fee is non-refundable  except in a situation where the training is cancelled.<br><br>

<li> Any Training must be completed within a window period of 1-month from when the student made registration, otherwise the training is void!<br><br> 
<li> The number of hours alloted to a training course (e.g 15hours), is a 'best judgement' estimation. Sometime, depending on the level of assimilation of the student, more hours might be required and in other cases the student might be fully trained in slightly less than the number of alloted hours. In a case where the training requires more time, there would be no extra charges from Trident.<br><br>

<li>All students are expected to comport themselves in a mature manner that is fair to other students during the training. Any student who incessantly constitutes nuisance during the training would be asked to leave without any refund of money.<br><br>

<li> All students are expected to be punctual as the instructors would not repeat course materials already covered to benefit late comers.<br><br>

<li> Students are advised to switch their mobile phones to silent mode and excuse themselves out of the class to receive phone calls.<br><br>

<li> Trident technologies would provide laptops and work stations (where required) during the training. However, students are strongly advised to come with their LAPTOPS so that training softwares can be installed directly on their PCs to make practice at home easy.<br><br>

<li> You are not allowed! to insert any personal memory sticks, external hard drives or storage devices of any sort to the computers used during the training. Trident would provide you with soft copies and hard copies of all printed materials you'll need during the training.<br><br>
